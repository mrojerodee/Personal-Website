            <h2>Opportunities</h2>
            <p>
                Throught this project, I got in close contact with <b>building a GUI-based Java application</b> which was a great experience because I felt like the game just leveled-up. Because of the business rules, I was forced to come up and <b>develop basic algorithms</b> that challenged my critical thinking skills. Furthermore, developing the <b>database</b> was an eye opener on what I have to deal with in the field of data science.

            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>
                While it may be a great learning opportunity, it's wasn't easy getting the job done. The first challenge I faced was the <b>interaction between the components in Java GUI</b>. Additionally, coming up with the proper <b>algorithms</b> was the real wall for me as I am not equipped with a good base in <b>mathematics</b> nor a <b>deeper understanding of programming</b> which I needed. Lastly, learning how to utilize the <b>database connectivity</b> took me a while to grasp, but I'm happy it worked out in the end.
