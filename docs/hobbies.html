            <h2>Games</h2>
            <p>
                Much like the people in my generation, I enjoy playing games as a way to unwind. I tried a lot of genres, but I noticed that some just don't stick around with me. I like action, strategic, and simulation games. I enjoy souls- like games among others. But I do seem to enjoy casual games that involve a community. Most of the games I can remember now are those that had an active community where I can just spend time chatting with people. It's a double sided sword that motivates me to play every single day, but after those people are gone, I also lose that motivation.

                Sometimes though, I play a little too much and lose my sense of reality. I forget my responsibilities, which makes me feel a sense of regret over the opportunity it costed me as a consequence. I am now reflecting on this and have since tried maintaining a balance between games and my life responsibilities.

            <h2>Puzzle-Solving</h2>
            <p>
                I find solving puzzles and problems enjoyable at times. I believe this is my strong suit in the course that I'm currently enrolled in. I enjoy it even though the process is a real mind bender that gives me a huge migraine. This is because at the end of each challenge is a huge burst of emotions that make me feel excitement for my achievement.

                The ones that I find myself coming back to are Sudoku, Solitaire, Rubik's Cube, Minesweeper, Hanabi, Jigsaw Puzzles, and etc.

            <h2>Balisong Flipping</h2>
            <p>
                This is a new hobby, I learned this three (3) months ago and barely practice using it because I often forget where I placed my trainers. But I really love it because of how cool it is, and also because I get to use it for fidgetting when I'm bored, I'm thinking about something, and basically everything that doesn't restrict my right hand.

            <p>
                I don't know a lot of tricks, I don't think I can name most of the ones I know as I learned just the basics such as basic opens, basic closes, quick draw, y2k, fanning, wrist pass, and quite a few more that I just discovered on my own. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I am, however interested in learning quite a few more moves such as the zen roll-over and the index roll-over.

            <h2>Reading</h2>
            <p>
                I admit, I wasn't bright kid who loved reading since it had been introduced. But that doesn't mean I won't enjoy it given the right circumstances. That's exactly how it all started! I was engaged with this anime that I so really loved but unfortunately I'm too impatient to wait for the next release. What I did was to look up its equivalent in manga, and I enjoyed it. I enjoyed it so much I transitioned into other titles and when I found manhuas, I liked that it has colors and unique stories different from that of what I already read. A few months into that, webtoons or more commonly known as manhwas emerged and they were like a breath of refreshing air. The art was so good and the character settings were expanse. Not only that, most of these stories know how to touch my heart and so I confided in them.
